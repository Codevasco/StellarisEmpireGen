## **Stellaris Empire Generator**

#### **Description**

This application generates a civilisation (called an Empire) for the Paradox Interactive game, Stellaris. The Empire has several Options that influence its behaviour within the game, affecting how it plays and what mechanics it has access to. Currently, the application only generates an Empire purely based on the base game and will not include DLC-based options and mechanics such as Hive Mind (Utopia DLC), Machine Intelligence (Synthetic Dawn DLC), etc.

Options include Authority, Ethics, Species and Traits.

#### **Terminology**

[Empire](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Empire): An Empire is a group of planets and star systems that are ruled by the same government and controlled by a single player (or AI).

[Authority](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Government#Authority): An Empire's Authority determines how power is transferred in the government.

[Ethics](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Ethics): Ethics are the guiding principles of an Empire and its people and determine an Empire or population's favored courses of action and responses to situations.

[Species](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Species): Every habitable planet has the potential of developing different populations of intelligent beings that may, naturally or not, develop technologically. Sometimes, such beings reach a crucial point in their development that allows them access to FTL technology and, as a consequence, the ability to become full-fledged interstellar empires.

[Traits](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Traits): Traits represents a Species' innate functions, abilities, and personality.

#### **How to run**
